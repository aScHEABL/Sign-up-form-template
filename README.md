### Summary <br>

#### What I learned <br>

- [Unwanted behaviors](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35087330/using-display-flex-causes-purple-border-to-appear?answertab=trending#tab-top) with Flexbox. <br>
- Use relative position to replace margin. <br>
- Outline and border are two different properties with similar effects. <br>
- input would have textarea by default, and textarea has default textarea:focus property that can be easily confused with input:focus <br>
- background-image property placed directly within div property, without the need to insert another img, and crop the image by zoom in then use background-position to adjust the position of the image. <br>
- Use cases of pseudo-class. <br>
- Verification of input. <br>
